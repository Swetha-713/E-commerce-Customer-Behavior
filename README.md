🛒 E-commerce Customer Behaviour Analysis
📑 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior in an e-commerce environment. Using a real-world dataset, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to uncover insights into customer demographics, preferences, and purchasing patterns. This can help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve customer experience and boost sales.

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following key features:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer

Gender: Male or Female

Age: Age of the customer

Income Level: Customer’s income bracket

Purchase Amount: Amount spent per purchase

Category: Category of items purchased

Device Used: Device from which the purchase was made

Customer Rating: Rating given by the customer

Marital Status: Marital status of the customer

Loyalty Program: Indicates if the customer is part of a loyalty program

Purchase Intent: Whether the customer intended to purchase

⚙️ Tools and Technologies

🧹 Data Cleaning
Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately

Removed duplicate entries

Converted data types where necessary

Handled outliers in numerical columns

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Several visualizations were created to understand trends and patterns:

Pie Chart – Gender Distribution

Bar Chart – Purchase Categories

Box Plot – Income Level vs Purchase Amount

Histogram – Customer Satisfaction (Ratings)

Pie Chart – Device Used for Shopping

Stacked Bar Chart – Loyalty Program vs Purchase Intent

Bar Chart – Marital Status vs Average Purchase Amount

Each chart was analyzed to interpret customer behavior trends and actionable insights.

💡 Key Insights
Female customers showed slightly higher purchase intent than males.

Mobile devices were the most commonly used for shopping.

Customers in higher income brackets spent more but rated less often.

Loyalty program members had a significantly higher purchase intent.

Certain product categories were more popular among younger customers.

🧠 Conclusion
This project helps in understanding how various customer attributes influence their purchasing decisions. These insights can guide personalized marketing strategies, UI/UX improvements, and product placement.

🚀 Future Work
Build predictive models to forecast customer churn

Segment customers using clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means)

Develop a recommendation system
